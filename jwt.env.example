# Default token duration for all endpoints if not specified
GENERAL_DURATION="1h"

# Example endpoint configuration
# You can define multiple endpoints by using different prefixes (ONE_, TWO_, etc.)

# First endpoint example
ONE_BASEURL="https://example.com"
ONE_JWTSECRET="generate-a-secure-secret-and-place-it-here"
ONE_DURATION="1h"    # Optional: Token validity duration (1h = 1 hour, 30m = 30 minutes, 1d = 1 day)
ONE_NBF="0"         # Optional: Not Before offset in seconds (0 = token valid immediately)
ONE_IP="FALSE"      # Optional: Whether to include IP validation in token

# Second endpoint example (commented out)
# TWO_BASEURL="https://another-example.com"
# TWO_JWTSECRET="generate-another-secure-secret"
# TWO_DURATION="30m"
# TWO_NBF="300"     # Token becomes valid 5 minutes after generation
# TWO_IP="TRUE"     # Enable IP validation for this endpoint

# Notes:
# - JWTSECRET should be a secure random string
# - Duration format: numbers followed by 'm' (minutes), 'h' (hours), or 'd' (days)
# - NBF (Not Before) is in seconds
# - IP validation is optional and can be enabled per endpoint
# - File paths are automatically extracted from URLs and included in tokens
